# Custom Game Engine 🛠️

This repository contains the development of a custom game engine created for the module **COMP703 24/25** as part of my MSc Game Programming course. This project focuses on building a robust and flexible engine capable of supporting 3D gameplay experiences.

## 🌟 About the Project
This project aims to gain deeper insights into game engine architecture by building a custom solution from scratch. While the engine will be tested with a demake of *Portal*, the development of the engine itself is the main focus.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **OpenGL** (via **GLEW**) for rendering.
- **SDL2** for managing windows and input.
- Custom systems for physics, entity management, and rendering pipeline.

## 🚀 Planned Features
- Modular architecture for easier expansion and maintenance.
- 3D rendering pipeline with support for basic shaders and lighting.
- Scene and entity management to handle complex gameplay scenarios.
- Performance optimizations for real-time rendering and physics.

## 🧪 Testing with Portal Demake
To demonstrate the engine's capabilities, I plan to create a simplified version of *Portal* to demonstrate the engine's capabilities. This test case will:
- Validate the engine's ability to handle mechanics like portals.
- Showcase rendering and interaction systems in action.

## 📚 Key Learning Outcomes
- Advanced understanding of game engine design and implementation.
- Practical experience with OpenGL and SDL2 in a 3D context.
